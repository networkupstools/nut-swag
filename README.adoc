This repository is dedicated to various (primarily graphical) resources
which may be used to create memorabilia items related to the Network UPS
Tools project (NUT), such as swag for the NUT community memebers to
distribute on conferences (maybe in exchange for contributions of code,
promotion, money, or other resources), or just to print and keep privately.
